- **Reduces:** Fraud, mistakes, power misuse
- **Also called:** Separation of Duties, Dual Control

**Examples:**
- **Accounting:** Maker creates payment, Checker approves (separate privileges)
- **Data Centers:** One person holds room key, another holds server rack key
- **Banking:** Multiple signatures for large transactions

**Keywords:** Separation of Duties, Dual Control, Divided Authority, Maker-Checker, Fraud Prevention

---

## **Least Privilege**

**Definition:** Users receive **minimum privileges necessary** for tasks, nothing more

**Core Concept:**
- **Reduces damage** if account compromised
- Common violation: Admins giving broad access for convenience
- **Need-to-know basis**

**Examples:**
- Receptionist shouldn't have admin rights for software installation
- Web server process reads only needed folders, not whole filesystem
- Users get access only to resources required for job function

**Keywords:** Minimum Privileges, Need-to-Know, Access Restriction, Privilege Limitation, Account Compromise Protection

---

## **Defense in Depth Principle**

**Definition:** Security implemented in **multiple layers**, cascading security

**Core Concept:**
- If one layer fails, **other layers protect**
- Layered security approach
- **Redundancy** in protection

**Example Security Layers:**
Firewall → Antivirus → Intrusion Detection → Access Control → Encryption
- Hacker must **break each layer** to reach internal system

**Keywords:** Layered Security, Multiple Barriers, Cascading Security, Redundant Protection, Defense Layers

---

## **Security Through Obscurity**

**Definition:** Assumes attacker **doesn't know internal system details**

**Core Concept:**
- "Hiding" structure hoping attackers never understand
- **NOT effective as PRIMARY** security method
- Can be used as **SECONDARY layer**

**Examples:**
- Hiding admin panels at unusual URLs (`/admin98234/`)
- Keeping configuration paths secret
- Non-standard port usage

**Limitation:** Not replacement for actual security controls

**Keywords:** Obscurity, Hidden Structure, Secondary Layer, Configuration Secrecy, Non-Standard Paths

---

## **Fail-Safe Defaults (Fail Safes)**

**Definition:** Unless subject **explicitly allowed**, access **denied by default**

**Core Concept:**
- Default settings must be **secure, not permissive**
- Deny-all approach
- Explicit permission required

**Examples:**
- Firewall **blocks all ports**, only opens explicitly allowed
- File system **denies all users** unless permissions granted
- Default deny policy

**Keywords:** Default Deny, Explicit Allow, Secure Defaults, Deny-All Approach, Permission-Based Access

---

## **Economy of Mechanism**

**Core Concept:**
- Complex systems introduce bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities
- Simplicity = Security

**Benefits:**
- **Fewer bugs**
- **Easier auditing/testing**
- **Easier maintenance**
- **Harder for attackers** to find weaknesses

**Example:**
Small, clear access control policy safer than long, complicated one with exceptions

**Keywords:** Simplicity, Minimal Complexity, Bug Reduction, Easy Auditing, Simple Mechanisms, Maintainability

---

## **Complete Mediation**

**Definition:** **Every access** to object must be **checked every time**

**Core Concept:**
- No reliance on cached permissions
- Don't assume earlier checks still hold
- Continuous verification

**Example:**
User removed from group → system must **check permissions on every file access**
Otherwise user may still access resources until next refresh

**Keywords:** Continuous Verification, Every Access Check, No Cached Permissions, Real-time Authorization, Permission Verification

---

## **Psychological Acceptability**

**Definition:** Security mechanisms should **NOT make systems harder to use**

**Core Concept:**
- Inconvenient security → users ignore/bypass it
- **Usability balanced with security**
- User-friendly security

**Examples:**
- **Too strict password rules** → users write passwords on sticky notes
- Simple, clean login system more secure than confusing one
- Security shouldn't frustrate users

**Keywords:** User-Friendly Security, Usability Balance, Convenience, User Acceptance, Practical Security

---

## **Least Common Mechanism**

**Definition:** Resource access mechanisms should **NOT be shared** across users

**Core Concept:**
- Shared mechanisms increase: Interference, information leakage, unintended access
- **Isolation** between users
- Minimize shared resources

**Examples:**
- Each user has **own isolated temp directory** (not shared temp folder)
- Avoid shared system-wide services with high privileges
- User-specific resources

**Keywords:** Isolation, No Sharing, User-Specific Resources, Interference Prevention, Information Leakage Protection

---

# 4. SECURITY TRADEOFFS
