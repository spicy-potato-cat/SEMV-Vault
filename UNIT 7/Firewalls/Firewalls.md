A firewall maybe a computer system or a software service that is running on an existing router or server.


Firewalls can be classified based on
- Processing modes
- development era
- structure

## Processing Modes
Depends on how it processes the traffic to block traffic

### Packet Filtering
**Method** : Examines the
- header information of a packet.
- Source IP
- Destination
- Protocol
**Installed on** : TCP / IP based Network
**Functions on** : Network Layer ( OSI Model ) / IP Layer ( TCP IP )

A vague look at the packets:

#### Types of Packet Filtering FW
There are **3 types**.

- Static Packet Filtering
	- Requires Rules to be developed and installed with the firewall
	- Any changes are to be done by human intervention
	- Common Easy to setup
	- Static allow entire set of one type of packets to enter in response to authorized reuests

- Dynamic Packet Filtering
	- Can react to new emerging situations and update and create rules to deal with the event itself.
	- Drops all packets from a particular address when a lot of them are *Malformed*.
	- Dynamic Packet filtering allows only a particular packet along with a particular source destination.

- Stateful Packet Inspection: 
	- Keeps track of each connection between internal and external system using a **state table**.
	- State table includes
		- Which : Station has sent the packet
		- What : Content of the packet
		- When : Time
	- Instead of checking an ACL I will check our history of receiving packets.
	- Additional Compute required to check the state table.
	- Without checks Vulnerable to DOS Atttack

### Application Layer Proxy Firewall
- Method : Receives requests from the external network and acts on behalf of internal network. (Proxy Server)
- Installed on : Dedicated Computer.
- Functions On : Application Layer ( Layer 7 in OSI model )
- **Limitations** : 
	- Cannot check encrypted traffic
	- Restricted to a single application.
- **Benefits:**
	- Can cache frequent requests making service faster.

### Media Access Control ( MAC ) Layer Firewall 
- Method : Filters based on MAC ID and NIC ID ( Network Interface Card ).
- Installed On : Specific Host Computer.
- Functions On : Media access control *SubLayer* of Network Datalink Layer ( Layer 2 OSI ) 
- Used commonly to deny some devices access to LAN or some features.

## Structure / Architecture
Configuration depends on three factors
- Objectives
- Organizations Ability
- Implementations
- Budget

### Types of Structured Based Firewalls
- Single Bastion Hosts
- Screen Host Firewalls
- Screen Subnet firewalls
- Dual Homed Firewall

### Single Bastion Host
Any system/router/firewall that is exposed to the untrusted network can be called bastion host (AKA Sacrificial Host). 

Implementation : 
- Uses
	- NAT : Network Address Translation
	- PAT : Port Address Translation

Characterstics:
- Single Protection Device on the network perimeter
	- Commonly used in Residential Soho Environments
	- Single Office Home Office

A **dual homed host** usually has a bastion host with two network interface. One for internal and one for external.

Limitations:
- Lacks defence in dept
- Complicated to implement ACL

---
## Screen Host Architecture
Method : Combines Packet Filtering and application proxy server.
Architecture : Packet filtering router is the method to deny or allow request. Proxy Server is the bastion. 
Benefits : Caching of frequently accessed pages

## Screened Subnet Architecture With DMZ
Dominant architecture in todays network. Basically a [[#Screen Host Architecture| Screened Host Architecture]] with a DMZ. 

Basically the webserver or the front endpoints are going to be exposed to the users. The DMZ sits between two firewalls and the internal network sits after the internal firewall.

# Best Practices for Firewall
- All traffic from internal/trusted is allowed out. Allows member of the organization to access the services they need. Filtering and logging of outbound traffic can be implemented.
- The firewall device is never directly accessible from the public network for configuration or management purposes.
- Administrative access to firewall is denied to internal network as well. ( Excluding ADMINS & Preferably )
- SMTP Data is allowed to enter through the firewall but is routed to a well configured SMTP Gateway to filter phishing etc.
- ICMP Data should be denied on external interfaces. Example ping services. ICMP is a common method for hacker reconnaissance and should be turned off to prevent snooping.
- Telnet access Outwards to Inwards should be blocked from all Public Net
- Telnet Access to DNS should be blocked to prevent zone transfers
-
