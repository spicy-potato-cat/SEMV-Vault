Assumes a linear relationship between the input data and the output data.

Problem can be thought as of finding an equation to a straight line.

Where 
$$y = c_0 +c_1x_1 + \dots +c_nx_n$$
- With $n$ independent variables, $x_n$ 
	- Inputs
- One response variable, $y$ 
	- Output
- $n+1$ constants


### Slope
Indicates the steepness of a line change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable

Slope can be given as , $$C_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\overline{x})}{\sum{i=1}{n}(x_i-\overline{x}}$$

### Intercept
Indicates the location where it intersects an axis and represents the predicted value of the
dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.
$$C_0=\overline{Y}-C_1\overline{X}$$

### Example
**Model**: Predicting test score (`y`) based on hours studied (`x`)

$$\mathrm{Score}=\mathrm{Intercept}+\mathrm{Slope}\cdot \mathrm{Hours}$$

- **Intercept**: 40  
    → A student who studies **0 hours** is expected to score **40** (maybe from class participation or prior knowledge).
- **Slope**: 5  
    → **Each hour of study adds 5 points** to the score.

**Inference**:

- Intercept = **baseline ability**.
- Slope = **effectiveness of studying**

## 📊 Linear Regression Summary

### **Dataset Overview**

- Variables: ( X ) and ( Y )
- Mean values:  
$$    [ \bar{X} = 135.7,\quad \bar{Y} = 18.0 ]$$

### **Regression Formula**

[ Y = C_0 + C_1 X ]

Where:

- ( C_1 ) is the **slope**
- ( C_0 ) is the **intercept**

### **Calculations**

- Slope: [ C_1 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} = 0.146 ]
- Intercept: [ C_0 = \bar{Y} - C_1 \bar{X} = -1.91 ]

### **Final Regression Equation**

[ Y = -1.91 + 0.146X ]

### **Interpretation**

- **Slope ( C_1 = 0.146 )**:  
    For every unit increase in ( X ), ( Y ) increases by approximately 0.146 units.
- **Intercept ( C_0 = -1.91 )**:  
    When ( X = 0 ), the predicted value of ( Y ) is -1.91 (may not be meaningful depending on context).
